# cpp-cmake

Use this as a generic, project-neutral skill. Active repo guidance (`STYLE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, local examples, and user instructions) overrides these defaults.

## Source: `cpp-cmake`

# Modern CMake Targets

Use this skill for `CMakeLists.txt` and `.cmake` changes.

## Read first

- `CMakeLists.txt`
- `demos/demo_bgfx/CMakeLists.txt`
- `demos/demo_flatbuffers/CMakeLists.txt`
- any nearby `AGENTS.md`

## Rules

- Prefer target-based CMake.
- Prefer `target_link_libraries`, `target_include_directories`, and `target_compile_features` over broad global settings.
- Default to `PRIVATE` unless propagation is required.
- Keep generated files under `${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}`.
- Add generated outputs to target sources so dependencies stay visible.
- Keep vendored integrations explicit and readable.

## Generated file pattern

```cmake
add_custom_command(
  OUTPUT <generated-output>
  COMMAND ${CMAKE_COMMAND} -E make_directory <generated-dir>
  COMMAND <tool invocation>
  DEPENDS <tool-target> <inputs>
  COMMENT "Generating ..."
)
```

Then attach the output to the consuming target and add the generated include dir.

## Local patterns already in use

- vendored libs via `add_subdirectory(... EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL)`
- `flatc` via explicit custom commands
- bgfx `shaderc` via explicit custom commands and generated embedded headers
- per-target language level where useful, e.g. `target_compile_features(... cxx_std_20)`

## Prefer

- one target, one obvious job
- precise include scope
- explicit dependency edges
- readable names for generated paths
- small helper functions only when they remove real duplication

## Avoid

- hidden global include directories
- vague custom-command dependencies
- generated outputs in source directories
- magical file discovery when explicit lists are clearer
- broad root-build refactors without a clear reason

## Ask first before

- changing vendored layout
- switching build-tooling strategy
- introducing package-manager assumptions
- turning a demo build flow into a large shared pipeline
